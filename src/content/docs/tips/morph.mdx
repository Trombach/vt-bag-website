title: Optimizing View Transition
description: Morphing view transitions, especially those with text, might look weird at times. Here is how to fix that.
---

The default animation for `::view-transition-group()` takes the position, size,  and transformation of the old image and morphs them into position, size, and transformation of the new image. During the transition, it keeps the aspect ratio of both images. This is easy if both images have the same aspect ratio, for example if we let a thumbnail grow to the full picture. But how does it work when the aspect ratios differ?

## Interpolated Width, Responsive Height
While the group pseudo-element morphs, the contained images have this [default styling](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-view-transitions-1/#ua-styles):
```css title="user agent style sheet"
::view-transition-old(),
::view-transition-new() {
  inline-size: 100%;
  block-size: auto;
  ...
}
```
With a horizontal writing mode, this means that the width of the images is equal to the width of the group and the height adapts so that the images are not distorted. As a consequence, the images itself might be much taller or smaller than the height of the `::view-transition-group` pseudo elements.

What you can often see with view transitions is that text grows or shrinks insanely while it fades in or out.

## Inline / Block Morph
A typical example is this: you morph a small element with a `display: inline` CSS property into a larger version of the same content but with `display: block`.

The two morphing images might look familiar to you. It is the "@vtbag" from the [splash screen](/) morphing into the "Overview" title of the [Overview page](/overview/). Both images have the same width but different heights as `<h1 />` on the splash screen is 50px while the `<h1>` on the normal pages is 40px.
