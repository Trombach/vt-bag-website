title: The View Transition API
description: Basics information about the View Transition browser API
---

The View Transition API is a rather new API. Eventually, this site will hold background  information about the API.

I made a start with information about the [structure of the pseudo-elements](/basics/pseudos/) of the API and about the [mechanisms of the default animations](/basics/default-animations/).

, but while I add more pages, I'm also happy that I can offer some links to previous work on the `astro-vtbot` package[^1].

* A [test page](https://events-3bg.pages.dev/jotter/api/test-page/) to test your browsers support for the View Transition API
* [References](https://events-3bg.pages.dev/jotter/api/references/) to helpful documents
* An [Overview](https://events-3bg.pages.dev/jotter/api/) and a [Details](https://events-3bg.pages.dev/jotter/api/details/) article on the API
* An in depth [same-document example](https://events-3bg.pages.dev/jotter/api/example/)
