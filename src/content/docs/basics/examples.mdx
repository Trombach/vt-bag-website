description: Basic examples on how to use the View Transition API for same-document and cross-document view transitions.

import DemoLink from "src/components/DemoLink.astro";

This page references a series of view transition examples, starting with basic configurations and progressively incorporating more features. The tables below provide a brief description of what distinguishes each example and includes a link to the live example which also includes its code and a detailed explanation.

The View Transition API automatically applies two primary types of animations to your elements:

* Exit/Entry animations, which include an exit animation for the old image and an entry animation for the new image.
* Group (or Morph) animations, where the transition group animates changes in width, height, and position[^position] from the old image to the new one.


[^position]: Here, *position* is used for simplicity. The group animation actually refers to both position and all applied CSS transformations, such as those defined by `matrix3d` or its specialized forms like `rotate`.

By default, both types of animations occur simultaneously. However, they might not always be noticeable. For instance, if elements with the same view transition name have the same size and position before and after the transition, the group animation will result in no visible change. Similarly, if the old and new images are identical, only the group animation will be visible, while the exit/entry animations won't produce noticeable effects.[^plus-lighter]

[^plus-lighter]: The cross-fade effect is more intricate than it appears at first glance. It works so smoothly because the default animations also set the [ `mix-blend-mode` CSS property to `plus-lighter`](https://events-3bg.pages.dev/jotter/api/example/#the--new-and--old-image-animation)

The [first set of examples](#same-document-view-transitiom-examples) focuses on **exit and entry** animations for **same-document** view-transitions, animating a component directly on its page.

The [second set of examples](#cross-document-view-transition-examples) highlights **exit and entry** animations of **cross-document** view transitions. Those are triggered by following a link to a new page.

While the first two sets demonstrate exit and entry animations, the [Image Morph Set](#image-morph-examples) introduces group animations, starting with image morphs, which tend to be easier compared to morphs involving text.


For morphing text with view transitions, we explore two additional sets: the Little Fail Set, which demonstrates various common failures, and the Improved Set, which attempts to address and enhance those issues.

## Same-Document View Transition Examples

These examples focus on a tab component where you can switch between different content sections. When you click on the headers, the content in the main area of the tab changes, but the component itself remains in the same position. As a result, these examples demonstrate **exit and entry** animations of the content only.

## Cross-Document View Transition Examples

These examples focus on a picture component where you navigate through individual pages, each displaying a different image. On every page, both the picture and the button that advances to the next page remain in the same position. While they move during the transition, these are purely **exit and entry** animations, with no morphing involved yet.

## Image Morph Examples


Morphing thumbnails into hero images is a classic use case for view transitions. Morphing animations share the characteristic that the position and/or size of elements with the same view transition name differ before and after the transition. The animation visually connects the two, showing that the small thumbnail serves as a placeholder for the larger image.

<div title="Select a link from the table below">
  <Card title="Thumbnail to Detail Morphs">
    <style>{`
#one img{
  width: 30%;
  height: auto;
}
#two img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}

  #one {
    width: 40%;

  }
  #two {

  Creating these example pages was a blast! They bring together a mix of Astro
  components, MDX partials, and endpoints. Best of all, with each example, you
  can simply hit <kbd>Ctrl-U</kbd> (or "view page source") to explore readable
  source code, free from all the typical clutter! And yes, these are still
  static pages generated with SSG.
