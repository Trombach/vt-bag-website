This section lists examples of view transitions, starting with the most basic settings and gradually adding more features. The table provides a brief description of what makes each example unique and includes links to the actual demo and its code.

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|<DemoLink href="/demo/BasicS/">Basic Same-Document</DemoLink>|Switching tabs with the default transition|
|<DemoLink href="/demo/BasicC1/">Basic Cross-Document</DemoLink>|Switching pages with the default transition|
|<DemoLink href="/demo/BasicAS/">Animated Same-Document</DemoLink>|Switching tabs with a custom animation|
|<DemoLink href="/demo/BasicAC1/">Animated Cross-Document</DemoLink>|Switching pages with a custom animation|

More to come. Especially morph animations.

<Card title="Side note">
Creating these example pages was a blast! They bring together a mix of Astro components, MDX partials, and endpoints. Best of all, with each example, you can simply hit <kbd>Ctrl-U</kbd> (or "view page source") to explore readable source code, free from all the typical clutter! And yes, these are still static pages generated with SSG.
