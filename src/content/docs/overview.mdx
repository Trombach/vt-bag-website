@vtbag is a comprehensive toolkit designed to simplify a developer's experience when working with view transitions.

You're getting a sneak peek at the very beginning stages: the first feature in the toolkit is the [Inspection Chamber](/inspection-chamber/).

More tools are on the way, and I’m always excited to hear your suggestions and learn what would be most helpful to you.

## Relation to astro-vtbot

Some of you might be familiar with [astro-vtbot](https://events-3bg.pages.dev), the big sister, or at least the spiritual predecessor, of @vtbag: Even when the new View Transition API in Chrome was only accessible behind flags, the Astro project had already anticipated parts of the level 2 specification, enabling cross-document view transitions for MPAs. Of course, Astro's client-side router isn’t technically comparable to level 2 view transitions and has its own challenges in handling scripts and state, but it allowed many users to experiment early and build expertise in view transitions.

Astro-vtbot, as a community project, built on that foundation by offering technical demos, reusable components, and a wealth of tips and tricks for using view transitions in Astro projects.

## Several Bags of Tricks
With the wider adoption of the view transition API and the introduction of level 2, cross-document transitions can now be defined purely with CSS, without the need for an additional client-side router. @vtbag is your go-to resource for framework-agnostic support around view transitions.

@vtbag inherits the concept of a Bag of Tricks from astro-vtbot: a diverse collection of tricks, tips, components, and tools. While astro-vtbot continues to focus on the specific needs of the Astro router, @vtbag aims at the view transition API in general, without being tied to any specific framework.

Both astro-vtbot and @vtbag might be referred to as "The Bag" as typically the context makes it clear which one is meant.
