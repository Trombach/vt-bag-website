This example features a display with two tabs. Selecting a tab switches the content.

### HTML

The HTML part for this example just defines two tab headings and two alternative tab contents. The CSS class `active` is used to highlight the current heading and to select the tab-content to be shown.

```html
<div class="tabs">
  <div class="tab active" data-tab="tab1">Dad Jokes</div>
  <div class="tab" data-tab="tab2">Punny Puns</div>
</div>
<div class="tab-content active" id="tab1">
  <p>Why don't skeletons fight each other?<br>They don't have the guts.</p>
  <p>I'm reading a book on anti-gravity.<br>It's impossible to put down!</p>
</div>
<div class="tab-content" id="tab2">
  <p>I'm on a seafood diet.<br>I see food and I eat it.</p>
  <p>Why don't some couples go to the gym?<br>Because some relationships don't work out.</p>
</div>
```

### Script Part

The script part adds listeners for the click event to the tab headings.

```html
<script>
  const mayViewTransition = (fun) =>
    document.startViewTransition
      ? document.startViewTransition(fun)
      : fun();
  document.querySelectorAll(".tab").forEach((tab) => {
    tab.addEventListener("click", () => {
      mayViewTransition(() => {
        document
          .querySelectorAll(".tab, .tab-content")
          .forEach((el) => el.classList.remove("active"));
        tab.classList.add("active");
        document
          .getElementById(tab.getAttribute("data-tab"))
          .classList.add("active");
      });
    });
  });
</script>
```
This script includes a function that modifies the DOM when a tab header is clicked, utilizing `document.startViewTransition` to create a smooth transition from the state before the click to the state afterward.

To ensure compatibility across different browsers, the script uses a wrapper function called `mayViewTransition`. This wrapper checks if the native view transition API is supported. If it is, `document.startViewTransition` is called; if not, the DOM-changing code is called directly. This approach is a best practice for using `document.startViewTransition`, as it prevents errors in browsers that lack native support for view transitions.

### View Transition specific CSS
In this example, no specific view-transition-name properties are defined. Instead, the example relies on the default view transition name, `root`, which the browser automatically applies to the `<html>` element. This means that the old and new images are those of the viewport before and after the transition and the default effect is a cross-fade between the two images.
